## Introduction
 ### Why do we need TIMERS?
  * TIMERS help in scheduling the events to be triggered or fired in a software or an application in future for ONE SHOT or PERIODICALLY.
  * TIMERS  are extensively used in many domains of Computer Science, expecially in Networking.
   #### TCP Timers.
   * Timer for scheduling an acknowledgement packet
   * Timer to run its Back-off Algorithm.
   #### OTP Time Outs.
   #### Session Log Out.
   #### Periodically sending out Network Packets
   #### Defining/ Scheduling the computation.
  * One of the most common programming concept that you would come across is TIMERS.
